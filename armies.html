      <b>
        Land Drus Kuni:Atk/5,def/8 morale unbreakable as long as the king is alive.
      </b>
      <p>
 An old unit with a history as old as the empire, supposedly formed when the great explorer Marin Moraru made landfall and formed a guard to watch over the camp, since then kings of Thorgar had them as personal guards and as the cream of their army. 
      </p>
      <img src="/Images/MarinMilitia.png">
      <b>
        Peasant levy:atak/1, def/3, morale 2.
      </b>
      <p>
    Men and boys from various walks of life, generally from the rural areas of a kingdom, forced or convinced to take up arms for their lords, not exactly defenseless and can hold the line for a while, but will be outdone by better armed and armored regiments.

      <b>
        Candlekeep War Wizards:atk/4, def2, morale 4, can cast magic missile as a ranged attack.
      </b>
      <p>
        Part mercenaries, part students and employees of Candlekeep, the great university of Bernach. Mostly tasked with keeping peace on the campus and keeping any wrongdoers away from the precious books, Master Hanumund made sure to create a flexible fighting force, meant to overwhelm enemies with magic ignoring defense. They can deal a lot of damage with thyer magic and are fierce on the attack but with little armor and no shields means that their defense will fall quincey.
      </p>
      <img src="/Images/Twarhei Battle Clerics.png">
      <b>
      Twarhey Clerics: atak/3, def/3, morale 5, can cast healing word
      </b>
      <p>
    Men infatuated by the word of Solaire and disappointed in their fellow man and their failure to follow  the light. Better equipped for defense they are well motivated and will not disappoint God with cowardice in the face of heretics and evil. Formed to bring order to a city falling apart to the anarchy of civil war, they were well suited to driving away bandits and Sulheim raids in enough numbers. 
      </p>

      <b>
    Sulheim Men at Arms: atk/5, def/7, morale 6
      </b>
      <p>
    Gathering from the villages and towns around the Barony of Sulheim, these men are the result of the new found power and wealth of Baron Daren in the wake of the civil war. Taken at a young age they are trained dailey and have plenty of practice on unruly peasants. Equipet with great armor and weapons, they make the core of Sulheimâ€™s army blindly loyal and confident, a unit not to be underestimated.

      </b>
      <p>
 The lesser nobility of Sulheim, men that are trained by the best, equipped with the best armor and weapons the barony can offer, theyr charge is as devastating as the famed Serte Knights, smashing any unit unlucky to find itself in their way they can put a swift end to any battle.
      </p>

      </b>
      <p>
    The newest addition to the barons army, they have been recruited from the local hunters and foresters meant to guide and be an agile force better suited to the forest and mountains of the rest of the kingdom.

Their bows can cause devastation upon their enemies from a great distance, further good armor and long swords make them capable in mele.

      <b>
    Sulheim Regulars: atk/2, def/4, morale 4.
      </b>
      <p>
    Units made up quickly in order to garrison just about any region the barony, usually equipped with second hand and old weapons and much more lightly armored than the men at arms. Despite this they received some formal training and will perform better than any levy.
      </p>
      <img src="/Images/Sulheim Sergeants.png">
      <b>
    Sulheim Crossbowmen: Atk 4, def 5, morale 6, can range attack. 
      </b>

    Khiz Sand Striders:atk/5, def/3, morale 4, have a ranged attack.
      </b>
      <p>
     Experts in guerilla fighting these warriors are just as good as archers or infantry, making them a flexible unit with much damage potential. Originally recruited from the Khiz tribes from at the edge of the great desert, these men are touched up by a dangerous environment and the threat of constant Szthian raids.
