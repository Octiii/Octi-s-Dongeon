    <h1>ElfLand Adventure.</h1>
    <p>
      In a corner of the universe, lies a peaceful land. Forests in the distance have been going quiet recently, human visitors have become less and less common and in Morwell, a kingâ€™s man had come and taken all the men with promises of glory. An unnatural feeling of unease permanently  permeates your elf society, the feeling of something breathing down your neck... 
    </p>
    <p>
      Something is afoot, go to the humans in the valley and     
      investigate. 
    </p>
    <h2>The Elfs.</h2>
    <p> Original inhabitants of the Land, they are immortal and do not age but are heavily reliant on nature and the forest. Depending on the environment they live in they change their physical appearance over time and become adapted to it. They are perfectly in tune with their dimension and can feel life as objects around them.</p> 
      
<p>The elves mostly live secluded lives within nature and mostly keep away from any other races, few as they are.</p> 

<p>The elves have an entirely alien anatomy to humans. They do not eat the same way and do not need to breathe. They absorb nutrients through other plants and from the ground but they do need to consume water which they can absorb through their skin. They communicate their thoughts through a direct connection which is maintained through a metaphysical plane created by the consciousness of the forest and plants and animals living in symbiosis in nature. It is a network but far from a hive mind.</p> 

<p>They can change their physical form and even enbody new ones through the network. Changing a current body takes time and experience and can only be done a bit at a time. Pretty much anything they can imagine and can physically be done these elves can change to.</p> 
  
<p>They usually appear as tall slender creatures with large eyes and pointy ears. They have no mouths, and do not wear clothes or have any genitalia.</p>    

<p>In terms of the mechanics of the game this means that the player's character will start with a base of 10 for all stas. A set amount of points will be given to begin with and on level ups extra will be given or feats instead. So to change the stat points around or to change the shape of the body it can be done once a long rest and will take a 4 hour session of meditation during which the metamorphosing character can't do anything. The player will be asked kindly to point to an existing rule set for stuff like for example growing wings and the rules for fly, if that is not possible and would like other effects a general rule of thumb will be that for example growing a wing will cost a stat point to be subtracted and used for the wing.</p>    

<p>The elves in their current form are adept at exploring and patrolling the vast forests. A simple humanoid figure is great for this purpose. The elves start with a bit of equipment, mainly some food to give as gifts and tools. </p> 
<h2>The Humans.</h2>

<p>Called Oameni by the elves are a more recent addition to the world. Originally arrived 2000 years ago on the Farshore, they brought their god with them, a golden idol of the sun and have been aggressively expanding across the land. Eventually most of these old men named by the elves, Balauri, disappeared one day and the ones left behind are more civilized, more at ease with their environment and still struggling to find their place in our world.</p>    

<p>They mainly live in large settlements made of wood dirt and stone on the sides of rivers and only rarely venture into the forests. As far as we know they are a fractured race, distrustful of their own, raising tall stone walls around their homes and often making battle with one another. They have an affinity to exploiting the forest and only recently have they decided to be more mindful.</p>
